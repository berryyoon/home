Hello! I am **Byeolyi Yoon**, incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Engineering.  
My research interests lie at the intersection of **Usable Security**, **Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)**, and **User eXperience**.

I am particularly passionate about designing security systems that balance robust protection with human cognitive capabilities.  
With a background in Computer Science and Industrial Engineering (Human Factors), I aim to bridge the gap between technical security requirements and real-world user experience.

Previously, I have worked as a Quality Assurance Engineer in a cybersecurity company, focusing on security usability evaluation for account control web systems.  
I have also participated in international peacebuilding programs, exploring the role of AI in promoting digital security norms.

My long-term goal is to contribute to the development of safer AI systems and more human-centered cybersecurity frameworks.

Feel free to [contact me](mailto:stardl9393@gmail.com) if you are interested in collaboration or discussions!
